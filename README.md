# APB-Protocol-Project-
APB master with two slaves read and write operation


![](https://github.com/WazaAbdulkadir/APB-Protocol-Project-/blob/main/image/yongatek%20.png)

I have added 2 slaves to the project and top module. 
In this part of the project I am reading data from slave 1 ,and in the master I am adding 10 to this data. Then I write sum of the operation -new data- to the slave 2. 
I have used 9 bit address. I used 9th bit as slave select. When 9th bit is 1 slave_1 is selected. 
Schematic of this project can be seen in the following figure.
